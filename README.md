MongoDB Demo with PHP

This project demonstrates how MongoDB can be used in a PHP web application.
It is a very basic project for beginner level programmers.

MongoDB connection from MongoLab hosting (https://mongolab.com) is used in this project demonstration, however a locally installed
instance can also be used with appropriate modifications in code.

While running this application on your server, please make sure:

1. Mongo PHP driver is installed
2. Correct Mongo DB URL and credentails are used in mongo.php file.
